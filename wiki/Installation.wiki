= MobileGTD installation =
After having installed Python for Series 60, just download the MobileGTD and the MobileGTDData package for your mobile phone and install them to your internal memory (Drive C:) either using Nokia PC Suite or directly downloading them with your mobile phone.


*That's it*

Start MobileGTD from your menu and give it a first shot!
= Optimization =
I found it quite important to have MobileGTD and the file explorer quickly accessible (your inbox must always be at hand). So I configured the left and right softkeys to start MobileGTD and the file explorer.
