= Can I configure MobileGTD so that SMS messages do not show up? =

Yes, starting from version 0.9.5 you can.
The reason for including the SMS messages here, is that often there is an action or project resulting from the message.
I move all messages to custom folders "Reference" or "Done", so my SMS inbox, like my EMail inbox is empty.
But nonetheless, here is how you can change this.
== Version 0.9.5 ==
Edit the main configuration file (usually at c:\system\data\mobile_gtd.cfg) and set read_sms:0
== Version 1.0 ==
In MobileGTD choose "Options" -> "Edit global configuration" and set read_sms to 0 there.
