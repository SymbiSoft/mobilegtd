= Quick Access = 
I found it quite important to have MobileGTD and the file explorer quickly accessible (your inbox must always be at hand). So I configured the left and right softkeys to start MobileGTD and the file explorer.
= Configuration =

  * Add a @Today folder in the GTD folder
  * Add an abbreviation for it to abbreviations.cfg
  * Add a folder "Daily" in the GTD folder (or a "Reference" subfolder) where you put actions you have/want to do every day

= Daily Routine =

  * Copy the content of your "Daily" folder to @Today
  * Copy the folders for all contexts which you will be in today to @Today
  * Browse the copied folders and delete all actions you don't want to do today
