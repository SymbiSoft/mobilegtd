= Setting up the configuration =
== Configuring the path of your GTD data ==
After installing the MobileGTD and the MobileGTDData package you have a GTD directory `C:\Data\GTD`. If you want to change this move the directory somewhere else and update the main configuration file `C:\system\data\mobile_gtd.cfg`
== Configuring abbreviations for contexts ==
In your GTD directory there is a configuration file called `abbreviations.cfg`. Edit it to define abbreviations for contexts. When entering actions you can use those abbreviations. Remember to put a slash at the end of each context path.
== Key shortcuts and menu entries ==
In your GTD directory there are two configuration files called `actions.cfg` and `projects.cfg`.
Each one contains several lines in the following format:
{{{
function_name:key_shortcut, String for menu entry
}}}
You can change the key shortcuts and the menu strings but you *must* keep the function names.
