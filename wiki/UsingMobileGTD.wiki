#summary How to use MobileGTD
= Projects View =
== Navigating ==
You can navigate your project list by using your cursor buttons. Alternatively you can search for projects by pressing `0` and entering one of the contained words.
== Creating a new project ==
To create a new project choose the `New Project` entry in the project list. You can always get there quickly by pressing `0` and then your select key (usually in the center of your cursor buttons). Press the select key again to create the project. MobileGTD will ask for a project name (can be changed starting with 0.8.5) and insert the new project at the start of the list.
== Creating a single action ==
To create a single action choose the `No Project` entry. You should use this with caution, almost all actions belong to a project that you might not have discovered yet (even writing a mail usually involves waiting for a response).
MobileGTD will ask for the project string, which is described a little down this page.

= Project Details View =
Careful: Projects are saved only when you exit the project details view. Be sure not to exit the application incidentally by pressing the Hang-Up button before exiting the project details view.
== Adding an info ==
To add an info simply press `4` and type the info you want to add. This can be used for desired outcomes and auxiliary information.
== Adding an action ==
To add an action press `2`. MobileGTD will ask for the action string.
=== Action strings ===
An action string looks like this:
{{{
Context Description (Info)
}}}


*Context* is the place or occasion where you can do the action, e.g. `Computer`,`Home`,`Errands`...
Contexts can be nested so you can e.g. use `Errands/Walmart`.
You can also define and use abbreviations for contexts (see [PostInstallation]).
One abbreviation I have defined for example is `26` which gets expanded to `Computer/Online` or `266` which gets expanded to `Computer/Online/Mail` (I tried to find context names that enable me to do a 1-to-1 mapping from the first letter of the context to its key on the phone).
You can also write `266Joe` which would get expanded to `Computer/Online/Mail/Joe`. Notice that I did not put a space between the numbers and the word following it. This tells MobileGTD to interpret `Joe` as part of the context. This is quite handy for the mail and agenda contexts.


The *Description* is what you will read when browing your action files. It should be something like `Imagine myself as being a black-belt GTD user`. It usually starts with or contains a verb, but some contexts are so self-defining that I do not use a verb (e.g. for mail or agenda actions I would just write what I want to say to or ask the person).


*Info* is the place where you can put informations specific to that action e.g. the telephone number of the person you want to call. This information does not get displayed in the project details view (though I might implement that one day).
