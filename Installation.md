# MobileGTD installation #
After having installed Python for Series 60, just download the MobileGTD (and the MobileGTDData if you prefer to use a stable version prior to 0.9.5) package for your mobile phone and install them to your internal memory (Drive C:) either using Nokia PC Suite or directly downloading them with your mobile phone.


**That's it**

Start MobileGTD from your menu and give it a first shot!
# Optimization #
I found it quite important to have MobileGTD and the file explorer quickly accessible (your inbox must always be at hand). So I configured the left and right softkeys to start MobileGTD and the file explorer.
