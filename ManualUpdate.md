# Introduction #
In some cases, especially when you have already modified some configuration files, it may be best to not install the MobileGTDData package but instead add the configuration items that changed.

# 0.8.5 -> 0.9.0 #
  * Add "inactivity\_threshold:14" (or after whatever many days you want to schedule inactive projects for review) to the main configuration file (C:\system\data\mobile\_gtd.cfg)
